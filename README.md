# 📚 Welcome to BookLover!

BookLover is a web application designed to help users organize and manage their reading lists.

BookLover is currently at the MVP stage, serving as a foundation for future features and iterations.

## Tech Stack

- React – UI development
- Vite – fast development environment
- React Router – client-side routing
- Supabase – authentication, database, and backend services
- Playwright – End-to-End Testing
- Deployment – deployment service to be finalized
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- A Supabase account

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment variables

## Project Status

BookLover is currently in the MVP stage.
The project focuses on clean architecture, core features, and real-world workflows (authentication, CRUD operations, testing, and deployment).

## Why this project?

This project demonstrates:

- the ability to design and structure a React application
- integration of a real backend (auth + database)
- handling of common product features (auth, CRUD, routing)
- testing and deployment in a realistic environment
- the ability to make technical decisions and manage a project from concept to delivery

BookLover was born from a real personal need: my family and I read a lot, and we wanted a simple and efficient way to organize and track our reading lists.
This real-world context guided both the functional scope and the technical choices made throughout the project.

## Design

The application was initially designed using Figma, where I created the first mockups and user flows.
This design phase is something I genuinely enjoy and consider essential for building coherent and user-focused applications.
